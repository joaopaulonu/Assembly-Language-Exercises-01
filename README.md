# Assembly-Language-Exercises-01

This repository showcases a set of 6 practical exercises developed in Assembly language for the Computer Systems Organization course at Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC-Campinas). Under the guidance of Professor Ricardo Pannain, these exercises provide a hands-on introduction to low-level programming for DOS environments, covering essential concepts from basic console interaction to more complex logic and arithmetic.

The purpose of this project is to document the initial steps in Assembly programming, illustrating fundamental techniques and problem-solving approaches in a resource-constrained environment.

Exercises Overview:
Each .ASM file corresponds to a specific exercise, progressively introducing new Assembly concepts:

> ATIV1_1.ASM - Basic Message Display:
This program is the simplest, designed to display two predefined text messages on the console. It demonstrates fundamental output operations, including cursor positioning and new-line characters.

> ATIV1_2.ASM - Single Character Input & Echo:
Introduces user interaction by prompting with a '?' character, waiting for a single character input, and then echoing it back to the console on a new line.

> ATIV1_3.ASM - User-Friendly Character Input:
An enhanced version of the previous exercise, providing a clear text prompt ("Digite um caractere: $") and a confirmation message ("O caractere digitado foi: ") along with the echoed character, improving user experience.

> ATIV1_4.ASM - Looping Character Input:
Adds a loop to continuously prompt for and display characters until the user presses the Enter key, demonstrating iterative programming structures.

> ATIV1_5.ASM - Input Count and Validation:
This code introduces input validation by asking the user to type exactly 5 characters. It reads the entire line, counts the input characters, and then informs the user if the quantity was correct or incorrect.

> ATIV1_6.ASM - Simple Sum Calculator with Validation:
The most complex program in the series, functioning as a basic single-digit addition calculator. It prompts for two numbers (0-9), calculates their sum, displays the result (handling two-digit sums like 18), and validates if the sum is greater than or equal to 9, displaying "Correto!" or "Incorreto!".

These exercises collectively provide an excellent foundation in Assembly programming for DOS, covering text display, data input, loops, conditionals, and basic arithmetic manipulation.
